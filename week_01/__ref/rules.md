# IDM 6660 Week 1 Assignment
## Due Sunday, January 22nd at 11:59 P.M. Central Time

### Submission

Once you have finished your code, please push a commit to your repo with the following title:
`Week 1 Assignment - FINAL`.

### Here are the rules for this assignment:

1. You should try to get your styled version of the website to match the screenshot as closely as possible.
  * The overall goal is to use as short, direct and readable CSS file as possible. Good assignments will get the site to match the screenshot, better assignments will do so with as few CSS styles as possible.
2. You may add classes to the HTML elements if you'd like, but keep in mind that it is possible to complete this assignment without them. The choice is yours, and your grade won't be affected either way.
3. You **may not** add any files, images or new HTML elements to the mark up. You may only use the CSS file provided. As noted above, you may not change anything about the HTML except adding classes.
4. You **may not** crop the image files supplied.

### Here are some hints about how the website for your first assignment was styled:

1. The font color used is not black. It's #111.
2. The link color in the first paragraph is not the default blue color. It's #0074d9.
3. The images are displayed at 640px wide.
