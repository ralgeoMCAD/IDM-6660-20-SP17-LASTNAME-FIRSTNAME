# IDM-6660-20-SP17-LASTNAME-FIRSTNAME

## A template Git Repo for the Spring 2017 section of IDM 6660: Responsive Design

Steps for usage in class:

1. **Create a GitHub Account** - You can do so here: [https://github.com/](https://github.com/)
  * I would recommend you use your mcad.edu e-mail to set up your account, though that is not required. I think that's the way to go because then your academic projects will be in an account that is separate from any other personal or professional GitHub accounts you might have.
2. **Download, install and sign into GitHub Desktop** - You can do so here: [https://desktop.github.com/](https://desktop.github.com/)
  * It's available for macOS and Windows. If you are not using either of those operating systems, please contact me to work out an alternative Git client.
2. **Fork this repo into your GitHub Account** - You can do this through the GitHub web interface by using the FORK link on the repo's main page.
  * **Change the name of the repo when you fork it!** All you need to do is replace the LASTNAME and FIRSTNAME in the repo name with your last name and first name. Please use the same first and last name that is on your registration for class. I will, of course, do my best to respect any preferred names when we are communicating with one another, but for ease of grading and feedback, it's much simpler for me if the names in the repo match those on the class registrations.
3. **Clone your forked and renamed version of the repo into your development environment** - This can be done either through the GitHub web interface by using the "Clone or download" button on the repo's web page or through the GitHub Desktop App.
  * It doesn't really matter where you clone your repo, except that you want to avoid cloning in into a folder that is inside your Dropbox folder. While Dropbox is an excellent service, and a big part of lots of development workflows, for technical reasons that are beyond the scope of this assignment, it doesn't really play nice with Git repos.
  * Please remember that cloning is not the same as downloading: It's better than that! When you clone a repo to your local computer, any changes you make are tracked through the Git version control and can be pushed back up to the repo on GitHub. That's what you want. If you just download the repo, you're only getting the code, and losing the .git file that connects the code back to the repo. That is not what you want.
4. **Working in your local repo, edit the first line of this file to accurately reflect the new repo name** - Again, you're just changing the name for repo to include your own. Make sure you leave in the Markdown syntax, which in this case means the line should start with a hashtag.
5. **Change the second line of content in this file to read as follows:** `## A Git Repo for my classwork files produced during the Spring 2017 Section of IDM 6660` Remember that those hashtags are there for the Markdown syntax
6. **Delete the rest of this file** - Only the first two lines of content should remain.
7. **Commit and Push the updated repo to GitHub** - You can do this through the GitHub Desktop app. Please name the commit: `Initial Fork, Clone and Edit`. You should also include a description, but it can be whatever you'd like.
8. **Add me as a collaborator to your remote version of the repo** - This can be done through the GitHub web interface by going to the Settings => Collaborators page and searching for my user name: `ralgeoMCAD`
